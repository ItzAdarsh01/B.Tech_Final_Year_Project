# B.Tech_Final_Year_Project
The Sign Language and Voice Interpretation project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and those who rely on spoken language.

Steps to Build the Project:

1. Data Collection Dataset: Collect a large dataset of images representing different sign language gestures. You can use publicly available datasets like the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset or create your own by capturing images. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images by resizing them to a uniform size, converting them to grayscale if needed, and normalizing the pixel values.


2. Data Augmentation Techniques: Apply data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting to increase the diversity of the dataset and prevent overfitting. Implementation: Use libraries like TensorFlow or Keras to implement data augmentation.


3. Model Design using Teachable Machine Teachable Machine: Used Google's Teachable Machine framework to design and train the CNN model. This tool simplifies the process of creating machine learning models, making it accessible without extensive coding. Architecture: The framework allows you to create a model with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers through an intuitive interface.


4. Model Training Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset. Monitor the training process using metrics like accuracy and loss. Validation: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to monitor the model’s performance on unseen data.


5. Testing and Iteration User Testing: Conduct testing with actual users from the deaf and hard-of-hearing community to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. Iteration: Iterate on the design and implementation based on user feedback to enhance the system’s accuracy and usability.
